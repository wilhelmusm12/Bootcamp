**1. The Problem**

A company provides loans/credit to customers with a certain nominal amount. When the company offers loans to customers, the company certainly expects the money back. Companies must consider several things related to the customer's ability to pay to minimize the risk when money is not returned. It can considered from customer characteristics such as income, age, profession, and others. Therefore, we act as one of the data scientist consultants who will develop the model of machine learning to answer how to predict customers or customers who have risk of default.
